        <p>Small businesses often struggle to get their orders on point. Sometimes they buy too little and sometimes
            they
            buy
            too much. In both cases there are costs attached with having a wrong purchasing strategy. We have created an
            analytical tool that will help you calculate your orders in a more accurate way.
            Tell us how many guests you are expecting and how much product you have on hand and we will suggest you how
            much
            you need to order!</p>
